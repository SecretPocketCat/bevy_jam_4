- [x] don't snap when placement is not possible (hexes occupied)
- [x] tween snapping
- [x] restore position on invalid drop
- [x] place hex
- [x] randomize pieces
- [x] check for lines
- [x] rotate pieces
- [x] rotate around the hovered hex
- [ ] spawn 2 options
- [ ] spawn next options, but not draggable
- [ ] finish map
- [ ] add ingredients on line clears
- [ ] remove ingredient from hex variant

## Scoring

- [ ] multi-line multipliers (probly just double it?)

## Extra

  - just a timer?
  - push your luck?
- [ ] refresh snapping on rotation
- [ ] fix pieces moving on rotation (tween them back)
